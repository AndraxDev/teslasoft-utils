# libmath-py

A simple mathematics library with basic functions. It can be used at educational purposes.

### How to use:

```py
from libmath import *
```

### List of functions:

- Factorial

```py
factorial(x)
```

- Power

```py
power(x, y)  # x^y
```

- Absolute

```py
absolute(x)
```

- Root

```py
square_root(x)

root(x, y)  # x^y
```

- Degrees to radians

```py
radian(x)
```

- Cosine, sine, tangent, cotangent

```py
# Do not forget to translate degrees to radians before using these functions
sine(x)
cosine(x)
tangent(x)
cotangent(x)
```

- Pi (If you have a powerful device)

```py
# Warning! This function requires a big amout of iterations (change variable "delta"). If you don't have a powerful device use const_pi instead
pi()
```

- Exponent

```py
exponent(x)
```

- Sigmoid

```py
sigmoid(x)
```

- Derivative of sigmoid

```py
sigmoid_derivative(x)
```

More functions will be added soon
